# About the project
### What is Churn?
Churn describes the rate at which customers discontinue their relationship with a business or stop using its services. It is usually presented as a percentage of the total customer base.

### What is Churn Rate?
The churn rate—also referred to as the attrition rate—measures how many customers a company loses within a specific time frame. This can include customers who cancel or choose not to renew subscriptions. A high churn rate means a greater number of customers are leaving, while a low churn rate indicates strong customer retention. In general, maintaining a low churn rate is a positive sign for business health.

### Churn Rate Formula:
Churn Rate = (Number of Customers Lost / Total Customers) × 100%

### What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn is the ongoing process of losing and gaining customers that every business experiences. Even companies with excellent products or services face some level of churn. Common reasons for customer churn include dissatisfaction, better alternatives from competitors, or changes in the customer's needs or situation. Overall, the lower the churn, the more customers a business is able to retain.

# Insights

- Contract type significantly influences churn behavior. 
  Customers on month-to-month contracts are more prone to churn compared to those on longer-term agreements.
- Senior citizens show a higher tendency to churn.
- Among customers with month-to-month contracts (who make up 56% of the total), 24% have churned.
- Female customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit a higher churn rate than their male counterparts.
- Only 1% of customers on two-year contracts have churned, indicating strong retention in this group
- Within one-year contracts, male customers are more likely to churn than female customers.
- Similarly, among those with two-year contracts, male customers have a slightly higher churn rate than female customers.
- Longer tenure is associated with reduced churn—customers who have been with the company longer tend to stay.
- Churn is more common among customers using manual payment methods.
- Of the 44% of customers who use fiber optic internet, 18% have churned.

# Recommendations

- Promote longer-term contracts by encouraging customers to choose one- or two-year plans, which are associated with significantly lower churn rates.

- Introduce incentives such as discounts or added benefits—for customers willing to transition from month-to-month contracts to longer-term commitments.

- Design tailored solutions for senior citizens, addressing their specific needs and concerns to enhance satisfaction and minimize churn within this demographic.

- Implement targeted retention strategies for female customers on month-to-month plans, as they demonstrate a higher likelihood of churn compared to their male counterparts.

- Enhance payment convenience by offering more flexible and automated payment options, helping to lower churn among customers currently using manual payment methods.

- Investigate churn drivers among fiber optic users, and address any service or satisfaction issues to improve retention in this high-churn customer segment.
